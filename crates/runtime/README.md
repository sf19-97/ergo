# Primitive Library

This crate is the ergo runtime plus its bundled primitive library (the standard deterministic compute/trigger/action/source primitives that run inside it). The runtime defines the ontology and execution physics; the primitive library is the content executed within it.

Primitives are deterministic, manifest-defined units of computation, triggering, and action. They are enforced by runtime contracts and are the single source of truth for execution.

Terminology:
- Runtime: ontology + execution physics (validation, execution engine, wiring rules)
- Primitive library: stdlib of primitives packaged inside this runtime crate

This repository is:
- ontology-first
- deterministic by construction
- intentionally boring

It is NOT:
- a product
- a UI
- a strategy builder
- an orchestrator

Downstream systems depend on this library.
This library depends on nothing downstream.

## Core stdlib wiring

- Sources: `number_source`, `boolean_source`
- Computes: `const_number`, `const_bool`, `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `negate`, `gt`, `lt`, `eq`, `neq`, `and`, `or`, `not`, `select`
- Trigger: `emit_if_true`
- Actions: `ack_action`, `annotate_action`

Helpers:
- `catalog::build_core_catalog()` builds a `PrimitiveCatalog` for validation/inference
- `catalog::core_registries()` registers all stdlib implementations into runtime registries

## Hello world graph (reference)

This graph compares two static numbers, emits an event if `a > b`, and acknowledges it.

```
number_source(value=3.0) -> gt:a
number_source(value=1.0) -> gt:b
gt.result -> emit_if_true.input
emit_if_true.event -> ack_action.event
```

Sketch in Rust:

```rust
use primitive_library::catalog::{build_core_catalog, core_registries};
use primitive_library::cluster::{ExpandedEndpoint, ExpandedGraph, ExpandedNode, OutputPortSpec, OutputRef};
use primitive_library::runtime::{run, types::{ExecutionContext, Registries}};

let expanded = ExpandedGraph { /* nodes + edges per diagram above */ };
let catalog = build_core_catalog();
let regs = core_registries().unwrap();
let registries = Registries { sources: &regs.sources, computes: &regs.computes, triggers: &regs.triggers, actions: &regs.actions };
let ctx = ExecutionContext { trigger_state: Default::default() };
let report = run(&expanded, &catalog, &registries, &ctx)?;
```

The reference graph is also exercised in `runtime/tests.rs::hello_world_graph_executes_with_core_catalog_and_registries`.

## Golden Spike Tests

Two integration tests serve as canonical reference paths:

| Test | Location | Path |
|------|----------|------|
| `hello_world_graph_executes_with_core_catalog_and_registries` | `crates/runtime/src/runtime/tests.rs` | Direct: `runtime::run()` |
| `supervisor_with_real_runtime_executes_hello_world` | `crates/supervisor/tests/integration.rs` | Orchestrated: `Supervisor::new()` → `RuntimeHandle` → `runtime::run()` |

If either test fails, the execution path is broken.
