Compute Primitive Manifest — v0

1. Definition

A Compute Primitive is a pure, deterministic transform that maps
typed inputs → typed outputs on a declared execution cadence.

It:
	•	has no side effects
	•	performs no I/O
	•	does not know about execution mode
	•	is composable only via a graph
	•	contains no strategy or intent logic

The primitive itself is atomic.
All composition happens at the graph level.

⸻

2. Required Manifest Fields

Every compute primitive must declare all of the following.

2.1 Identity

id: string
version: string
kind: compute

	•	id is stable and unique
	•	version is semver or monotonic
	•	kind must be compute

⸻

2.2 Inputs

inputs:
  - name: string
    type: series | number | bool | event
    required: true
    cardinality: single | multiple

Rules:
	•	Inputs are explicit, named, and typed
	•	No implicit inputs exist
	•	Time, identifier, state, or context must be provided upstream
	•	Cardinality must be declared

⸻

2.3 Outputs

outputs:
  - name: string
    type: series | number | bool | event

Rules:
	•	Outputs are named and typed
	•	Multiple outputs are first-class
	•	No undeclared outputs are permitted
	•	All declared outputs must be produced

⸻

2.4 Parameters (Presets Only)

parameters:
  - name: string
    type: int | number | bool | string | enum
    default: any
    bounds: optional

Rules:
	•	Parameters are static presets
	•	Parameters do not change during execution
	•	Parameters must be fully serializable
	•	No hidden or dynamic parameters allowed

⸻

2.5 Execution Semantics

execution:
  cadence: continuous | event
  deterministic: true

Rules:
	•	continuous = evaluated every bar / tick
	•	event = evaluated only on upstream event emission
	•	Determinism is required

⸻

2.6 State

state:
  allowed: true | false
  description: optional

Rules:
	•	State is allowed only if:
	•	deterministic
	•	resettable
	•	time-indexed
	•	Rolling / windowed state is valid
	•	External or hidden state is forbidden

⸻

2.7 Side Effects

side_effects: false

Hard rule:
	•	Compute primitives may not perform I/O
	•	May not access network, filesystem, or external state
	•	If it touches the world, it is not compute

⸻

3. Prohibited Behavior

A compute primitive may not:
	•	Read or write files
	•	Access network resources
	•	Inspect execution mode
	•	Emit actions or alerts
	•	Access external state
	•	Mutate global state
	•	Branch on execution mode
	•	Accept undeclared inputs or parameters
	•	Emit undeclared outputs

Violation invalidates the primitive.

⸻

4. Composition Rule

Compute primitives are atomic.
Composition occurs only at the graph level.

No nested graphs.
No internal orchestration.
No embedded control flow.

This preserves determinism and debuggability.

⸻

5. Orchestrator Contract

The orchestrator guarantees:
	•	Inputs match declared types
	•	Execution cadence is respected
	•	State is reset deterministically
	•	Outputs are captured exactly as declared

The orchestrator does not:
	•	infer intent
	•	modify parameters
	•	tolerate non-determinism
	•	interpret semantics

⸻

6. Consequences

Because this contract is enforced:
	•	The manifest is the single source of truth
	•	User-defined primitives cannot cheat
	•	Node UIs are pure projections of the manifest
	•	Canvas values are presets, not logic
	•	All execution modes share identical execution paths

⸻

7. Scope

This document defines Compute Primitive Manifest v0.

It is intentionally minimal.
It will be tightened before expansion.
