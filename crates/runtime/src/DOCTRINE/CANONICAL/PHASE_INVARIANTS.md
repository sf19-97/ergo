# Phase Invariants — v0

**Tracked invariants:** 66

This document defines the invariants that must hold at each phase boundary in the system. It is the authoritative reference for what is true, where that truth is enforced, and what happens if it is violated.

**An invariant without an enforcement locus is not an invariant. It is a wish.**

---

## Preamble

### Purpose

This document serves as:
- The constitution of the system's correctness guarantees
- An audit baseline for code review
- A gap-detection tool for implementation work
- A portable reference for future contributors

### Enforcement Locus Definitions

| Locus | Meaning | Strength |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Spec** | Documented in frozen/stable specification | Declarative only — requires other loci for enforcement |
| **Type** | Impossible to violate due to Rust type system | Strongest — compile-time guarantee |
| **Assertion** | Enforced via `assert!` / `debug_assert!` / panic | Strong — fails loudly at runtime |
| **Validation** | Enforced by validation logic returning `Result::Err` | Strong — recoverable, explicit |
| **Test** | Enforced by test coverage | Weakest — detects regression, does not prevent |

**Rule:** Every invariant must have at least one enforcement locus beyond **Spec**. Spec alone is insufficient.

### Source Documents

This checklist draws from:
- `ontology.md` (frozen)
- `execution_model.md` (frozen)
- `V0_FREEZE.md` (frozen)
- `adapter_contract.md` (frozen)
- `SUPERVISOR.md` (frozen)
- `AUTHORING_LAYER.md` (stable)
- `CLUSTER_SPEC.md` (stable)

## Core v0.1 Freeze Declaration

**Effective:** 2025-12-22

Core is frozen at this point. The following constraints are now in force:

1. **No new core implementations** without a vertical proof demonstrating necessity
2. **Any core change** must introduce a new invariant with explicit enforcement locus
3. **Action implementations in core = zero** by design; capability atoms live in verticals

This freeze applies to:
- `src/source/`
- `src/compute/`
- `src/trigger/`
- `src/action/`
- `src/cluster.rs`
- `src/runtime/`

Doctrine documents (FROZEN/, STABLE/, CANONICAL/) retain their existing authority levels.

**To unfreeze:** Requires joint escalation to Sebastian with justification referencing a specific vertical that cannot function without the change.

---

## 0. Cross-Phase Invariants

These invariants hold across all phases. Violation at any point is a system-level failure.

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| X.1 | Exactly four ontological primitives exist: Source, Compute, Trigger, Action | ontology.md §2 | `PrimitiveKind` enum | — | — | — |
| X.2 | Wiring matrix is never violated (see ontology.md §3) | ontology.md §3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.3 | All graphs are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) | execution_model.md §2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.4 | Determinism: identical inputs + identical state → identical outputs | execution_model.md §8 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| X.5 | Actions are terminal; Action → * is forbidden | ontology.md §3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.6 | Sources have no inputs | ontology.md §2.1 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.7 | Compute primitives have ≥1 input | ontology.md §2.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.8 | Triggers emit events | ontology.md §2.3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| X.9 | Authoring constructs compile away before execution | V0_FREEZE.md §7 | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |

### Notes

- **X.1:** Enforced by type system. `PrimitiveKind` enum has exactly four variants.
- **X.4:** Determinism is tested but not structurally enforced. Acceptable for v0.
- **X.7:** ✅ **CLOSED.** Enforced in `compute/registry.rs::validate_manifest` (returns `NoInputsDeclared` when `inputs.is_empty()` for Compute manifests). Test: `compute_with_zero_inputs_rejected` in `compute/registry.rs`.
- **X.9:** Requires assertion at execution entry that no `ClusterDefinition` or `NodeKind::Cluster` survives.

---

## 1. Definition Phase

**Scope:** When a cluster is authored and saved.

**Entry invariants:** None (this is the origin point for authoring).

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| D.1 | Cluster contains ≥1 node | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.1 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

| D.10 | If declared signature exists, it is compatible with inferred | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §4 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| D.11 | Declared wireability cannot exceed inferred wireability | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §4, §6 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

### Notes

- **D.5–D.9:** Enforced in `cluster.rs::validate_cluster_definition` (returns `ExpandError::DuplicateInputPort|DuplicateOutputPort|DuplicateParameter|ParameterDefaultTypeMismatch`). Tests: `duplicate_input_ports_rejected`, `duplicate_output_ports_rejected`, `duplicate_parameters_rejected`, `parameter_default_type_mismatch_rejected`.
- **D.10–D.11:** Enforced during `expand()` via `infer_signature` + `validate_declared_signature` (`ExpandError::DeclaredSignatureInvalid`). Test: `declared_wireability_cannot_exceed_inferred`.

---

## 2. Instantiation Phase

**Scope:** When a cluster is placed in a parent context.

**Entry invariants:**
- Parent context exists and is valid
- Cluster definition passes Definition phase validation

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| I.1 | Wiring from parent edge source to cluster boundary kind is legal | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| I.2 | Port types match at connection points | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| I.3 | All required parameters are either bound or exposed | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| I.4 | Bound parameter values are type-compatible | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| I.5 | Exposed parameters reference parameters that exist in parent context | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| I.6 | Version constraints are satisfied | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.2 | — | — | ✓ | — |

### Notes

- **I.6:** Version constraint validation exists but lacks dedicated test coverage.

---

## 3. Expansion Phase

**Scope:** Recursive flattening of clusters to primitives.

**Entry invariants:**
- All referenced clusters are loadable
- All parameters are concretely bound (no unresolved `Exposed` bindings at root)

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| E.1 | Output contains only primitives (no `NodeKind::Cluster` survives) | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §7 | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| E.2 | All placeholder edges are rewritten to node-to-node edges | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §7 | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| E.3 | `ExternalInput` does not appear as edge target (sink) | (inferred) | — | ✓ | — | — |
| E.4 | Authoring path is preserved for each expanded node | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §7.2 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| E.5 | Empty clusters are rejected | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.1 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| E.6 | Original cluster definitions are not mutated | (inferred) | — | — | — | — |
| E.7 | `ExpandedGraph` carries boundary ports for inference only | (inferred) | — | — | — | — |

### Notes

- **E.3:** Requires assertion. Silent assumption is unacceptable.
- **E.6:** True by clone semantics but not explicitly enforced.
- **E.7:** Requires doc comment on `ExpandedGraph` to make contract explicit:

```rust
/// Expansion output. Contains only topology, primitive identity, and authoring trace.
/// `boundary_inputs` and `boundary_outputs` are retained for signature inference only
/// and must not influence runtime execution.
```

---

## 4. Inference Phase

**Scope:** Deriving signature from expanded graph.

**Entry invariants:**
- Expanded graph is complete (E.1–E.5 hold)
- `PrimitiveCatalog` is canonical and version-consistent

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| F.1 | Input ports are never wireable | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §3.2 | — | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| F.2 | Output wireability is determined by source node kind (Action → non-wireable) | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §3.2 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| F.3 | `BoundaryKind` inference follows precedence: ActionLike → SourceLike → TriggerLike → ComputeLike | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §3.4 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| F.4 | `has_side_effects` is true iff any expanded node is Action | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §3.3 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| F.5 | `is_origin` is true iff no inputs AND all roots are Sources | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §3.3 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| F.6 | Signature inference depends only on expanded graph + catalog (no other state) | (inferred) | — | — | — | — |

### Notes

- **F.1:** ✅ **CLOSED.** Fixed in cluster.rs. Enforcement:
  - Assertion: `debug_assert!` at cluster.rs:258
  - Test: `input_ports_are_never_wireable` at cluster.rs:1106
  - Merged.

- **F.6:** True by construction. Document on `infer_signature`:

```rust
/// Signature inference assumes a canonical, version-consistent PrimitiveCatalog.
/// Providing a catalog with different or incomplete primitive metadata will produce
/// undefined or incorrect signatures.
```

---

## 5. Validation Phase

**Scope:** Validating the unified DAG before execution.

**Entry invariants:**
- Graph is fully expanded (no clusters remain)
- Signature inference is complete

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| V.1 | No cycles exist in the graph | execution_model.md §2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| V.2 | All edges satisfy wiring matrix | ontology.md §3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| V.3 | All required inputs are connected | execution_model.md §2 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| V.4 | All type constraints are satisfied at edges | CLUSTER_SPEC.md §6.3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| V.5 | All action nodes are gated by trigger events | ontology.md §3 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| V.6 | All nodes pass validation before any action executes | execution_model.md §7 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |

### Notes

- Validation phase is well-covered by existing executor tests.
- **V.5:** Validation confirms structural wiring (Action has Trigger input). Runtime enforcement (R.7) additionally gates execution on `TriggerEvent::Emitted`. Both validation and runtime enforcement are now complete.

---

## 6. Execution Phase

**Scope:** Running the validated graph.

**Entry invariants:**
- All V.* invariants hold
- State is initialized per lifecycle rules

### Exit Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| R.1 | Each node executes at most once per pass | execution_model.md §1 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| R.2 | Nodes execute in topological order | execution_model.md §3 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| R.3 | No node observes effects from actions in same pass | execution_model.md §1 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| R.4 | Action failure aborts subsequent actions in same pass | execution_model.md §7 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| R.5 | Triggers are stateless (TRG-STATE-1) | execution_model.md §5 | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| R.6 | Outputs are deterministic given inputs + state | execution_model.md §8 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| R.7 | Actions execute only when trigger event emitted | execution_model.md §7 | — | — | — | ✓ |

### Notes

- **R.3:** ✅ **CLOSED.** Compositionally enforced by existing invariants:
  - F.2: Action outputs are non-wireable (`cluster.rs:324: wireable = meta.kind != PrimitiveKind::Action`)
  - X.5: "Actions are terminal; Action → * is forbidden" (validated at D.3, V.2)
  - Since no edge can originate from an Action, no node can observe action effects.
  - No separate test needed — enforcement is structural via wiring matrix validation.
- **R.4:** ✅ **CLOSED (by design).** `Result::Err` propagation via `?` is sufficient. `ActionOutcome::Failed` is data, not control flow — structural halt must be expressed via Trigger gating/wiring, not implicit runtime payload semantics.
- **R.5 / TRG-STATE-1:** ✅ **CLOSED.** Triggers are ontologically stateless.

### TRG-STATE-1: Triggers are stateless

| Aspect | Specification |
|--------|---------------|
| **Invariant** | Trigger implementations must not use observable, preservable, or causally meaningful state |
| **Enforcement** | Manifest: `state: StateSpec { allowed: false }` required for all triggers |
| **Locus** | Registry validation at registration time; manifest schema |
| **Violation** | Trigger with `allowed: true` rejected by registry |

**Rationale:** Triggers are ontologically stateless. A Trigger gates whether an Action
may attempt to affect the external world. It does not store information, accumulate
history, or own temporal memory. Execution-local bookkeeping (ephemeral scratch data
during evaluation) is permitted but does not constitute state — it is not observable,
serializable, or preserved across evaluations.

**Canonical Boundary Rule:** Execution may use memory. The system may never observe,
preserve, or depend on that memory.

**Temporal patterns** (once, count, latch, debounce) requiring cross-evaluation memory
must be implemented as clusters with explicit state flow through environment.

**Authority:** Sebastian (Freeze Authority), 2025-12-28
- **R.7:** ✅ **CLOSED.** Runtime now gates Action execution on `TriggerEvent::Emitted`. Implementation:
  - `should_skip_action()` in execute.rs checks for any `TriggerEvent::NotEmitted` input (AND semantics)
  - Skipped actions return `ActionOutcome::Skipped` for Event outputs
  - Test: `r7_action_skipped_when_trigger_not_emitted` verifies enforcement

---

## 7. Orchestration Phase

**Scope:** Supervisor scheduling of episodes.

**Source:** SUPERVISOR.md (frozen)

**Entry invariants:**
- Graph is validated (all V.* invariants hold)
- Adapter is available and compliant

### Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| CXT-1 | ExecutionContext is adapter-only | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| SUP-1 | Supervisor is graph-identity fixed | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | — |
| SUP-2 | Supervisor is strategy-neutral | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| SUP-3 | Supervisor decisions are replayable | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | — | — | — | ✓ |
| SUP-4 | Retries only on mechanical failure | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| SUP-5 | ErrKind is mechanical only | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | — |
| SUP-6 | Episode atomicity is invocation-scoped | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | — | — | — | — |
| SUP-7 | DecisionLog is write-only | SUPERVISOR.md §3 | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |

### Notes

- **CXT-1:** `pub(crate)` constructor; compile_fail doctests verify no external construction.
- **SUP-1:** Private `graph_id` field with no setters; set only at construction.
- **SUP-2:** `RuntimeInvoker::run()` returns `RunTermination` only; no `RunResult` exposure.
- **SUP-4:** `should_retry()` matches only `NetworkTimeout|AdapterUnavailable|RuntimeError|TimedOut`.
- **SUP-5:** `ErrKind` enum contains only mechanical variants; no domain-flavored errors.
- **SUP-7:** `DecisionLog` trait has only `fn log()`; `records()` is on concrete impl, not trait.

---

## 8. Replay Phase

**Scope:** Deterministic capture and verification of episode execution.

**Source:** SUPERVISOR.md §2.5, crates/adapter/src/capture.rs, crates/supervisor/src/replay.rs

**Entry invariants:**
- Capture bundle is well-formed
- All recorded events have valid hashes

### Invariants

| ID | Invariant | Spec | Type | Assertion | Validation | Test |
|----|-----------|:----:|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|
| REP-1 | Capture records are self-validating | — | — | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| REP-2 | Rehydration is deterministic | — | — | — | — | ✓ |
| REP-3 | Fault injection keys on EventId only | — | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| REP-4 | Capture/runtime type separation | — | ✓ | — | — | — |
| REP-5 | No wall-clock time in supervisor | — | — | — | — | ✓ |
| REP-6 | Stateful trigger state captured for replay | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | ✅ CLOSED BY CLARIFICATION |

### Notes

- **REP-1:** `validate_hash()` in capture.rs uses SHA256 to verify payload integrity.
- **REP-2:** `rehydrate()` uses only record fields; no external state dependency.
- **REP-3:** `FaultRuntimeHandle` explicitly discards `graph_id` and `ctx.inner()`; keys on `EventId` only.
- **REP-4:** `ExecutionContext` has no serde derives. Capture types (`ExternalEventRecord`, `EpisodeInvocationRecord`) are separate from runtime types (`ExternalEvent`, `DecisionLogEntry`).
- **REP-5:** Test at `replay_harness.rs:150-157` enforces no `SystemTime` usage in supervisor.
- **REP-6:** ✅ **CLOSED BY CLARIFICATION (2025-12-28)**

**Resolution:** Prior documentation suggesting "triggers may hold internal state" was a
semantic error that conflated execution-local bookkeeping with ontological state.

Triggers are stateless (see TRG-STATE-1). There is no trigger state to capture. Temporal
patterns requiring memory (once, count, latch, debounce) must be implemented as clusters
with explicit state flow through environment (Source reads state, Action writes state).

Replay determinism is preserved by existing adapter capture (REP-1 through REP-5). No
additional capture mechanism is required.

## Supervisor + Replay Freeze Declaration

**Effective:** 2025-12-27

The Orchestration Phase (§7) and Replay Phase (§8) implementations are frozen at this point. The following constraints are now in force:

1. **CXT-1 through SUP-7** are enforced as specified in SUPERVISOR.md
2. **REP-1 through REP-5** are enforced via capture.rs and replay.rs
3. **Capture schema** (`ExternalEventRecord`, `EpisodeInvocationRecord`) is stable
4. **Replay harness API** (`replay()`, `rehydrate()`, `validate_hash()`) is stable

This freeze applies to:
- `crates/adapter/src/lib.rs` (ExternalEvent, ExecutionContext, RuntimeInvoker, FaultRuntimeHandle)
- `crates/adapter/src/capture.rs`
- `crates/supervisor/src/lib.rs` (Supervisor, DecisionLog, DecisionLogEntry)
- `crates/supervisor/src/replay.rs`

**To unfreeze:** Requires joint escalation per AGENT_CONTRACT.md v1.1.

---

# Stage D Verification (stress test)

No implementation required. State is already fully externalized and governed by existing invariants (CXT-1, SUP-*, REP-*). Stage D consists of stress-testing replay determinism and orchestration boundaries; any failures indicate invariant regression and require escalation.

## Appendix B: Code Review Protocol

When reviewing any PR, ask:

1. **Which invariants does this code touch?**
2. **For each touched invariant, is enforcement preserved or strengthened?**
3. **Does this PR introduce any new implicit assumptions?**
4. **If an invariant is weakened, is the weakening explicitly documented and justified?**

A PR that cannot answer these questions is incomplete.
