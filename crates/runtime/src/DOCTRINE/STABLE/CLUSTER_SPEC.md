This document defines the formal specification for clusters.
It includes data structures, inference algorithms, and validation rules.

This specification implements the authoring layer defined in `AUTHORING_LAYER.md`.

---

## 1. Data Structures

### 1.1 Cluster Definition

```
ClusterDefinition {
    id: String,
    version: Version,
    
    // Internal structure
    nodes: Map<NodeId, NodeInstance>,
    edges: List<Edge>,
    
    // Boundary
    input_ports: List<InputPortSpec>,
    output_ports: List<OutputPortSpec>,
    parameters: List<ParameterSpec>,
    
    // Optional declared signature (verified against inferred)
    declared_signature: Option<Signature>,
}
```

### 1.2 Node Instance

```
NodeInstance {
    id: NodeId,
    kind: NodeKind,
    parameter_bindings: Map<String, ParameterBinding>,
}

NodeKind =
    | Impl { impl_id: String, version: Version }
    | Cluster { cluster_id: String, version: Version }
```

### 1.3 Edge

```
Edge {
    from: OutputRef,
    to: InputRef,
}

OutputRef {
    node_id: NodeId,
    port_name: String,
}

InputRef {
    node_id: NodeId,
    port_name: String,
}
```

### 1.4 Port Specifications

```
InputPortSpec {
    name: String,
    maps_to: GraphInputPlaceholder,
}

OutputPortSpec {
    name: String,
    maps_to: OutputRef,  // References internal node output
}

GraphInputPlaceholder {
    name: String,
    ty: ValueType,
    required: bool,
}
```

### 1.5 Parameter Specification

```
ParameterSpec {
    name: String,
    ty: ParameterType,
    default: Option<ParameterValue>,
    required: bool,
}

ParameterBinding =
    | Literal { value: ParameterValue }
    | Exposed { parent_param: String }
```

---

## 2. Signature

The **Signature** is the canonical description of a cluster's boundary.

```
Signature {
    kind: BoundaryKind,
    inputs: List<PortSpec>,
    outputs: List<PortSpec>,
    has_side_effects: bool,
    is_origin: bool,
}

PortSpec {
    name: String,
    ty: ValueType,
    cardinality: Cardinality,
    wireable: bool,
}

BoundaryKind = SourceLike | ComputeLike | TriggerLike | ActionLike

ValueType = Number | Series | Bool | Event | String

Cardinality = Single | Multiple
```

---

## 3. Signature Inference Algorithm

Given a cluster definition, the signature is inferred as follows:

### Step 0: Expand to Implementations

```
G_expanded = expand_all_clusters(cluster.nodes, cluster.edges)
```

All nested clusters are recursively expanded until only implementations remain. Partial expansion is not permitted.

### Step 1: Compute Boundary Port Sets

```
B_in = cluster.input_ports
B_out = cluster.output_ports
```

Validate:
- Every `B_out` reference exists in `G_expanded`
- Port names are unique
- Each port's type is inferrable from its source

### Step 2: Infer Port Types and Wireability

For each output port `p` in `B_out`:

```
referenced_node = G_expanded.nodes[p.maps_to.node_id]
referenced_output = referenced_node.manifest.outputs[p.maps_to.port_name]

p.ty = referenced_output.value_type
p.cardinality = referenced_output.cardinality

if referenced_node.kind == Action:
    p.wireable = false  # Action outputs are never wireable
else:
    p.wireable = true
```

Action outputs are never wireable, regardless of output type. No future Action manifest may override this rule.

For each input port `p` in `B_in`:

```
p.ty = p.maps_to.ty
p.cardinality = inferred from usage or declared
```

### Step 3: Infer Flags

```
has_side_effects = G_expanded.nodes.any(n => n.kind == Action)

is_origin = B_in.is_empty() AND 
            G_expanded.roots.all(n => n.kind == Source)
```

Where `roots` are nodes with no incoming edges from other nodes in the subgraph.

### Step 4: Infer BoundaryKind

```
has_wireable_outputs = B_out.any(p => p.wireable)
wireable_out_types = B_out.filter(p => p.wireable).map(p => p.ty).to_set()
has_wireable_event_out = Event ∈ wireable_out_types

if !has_wireable_outputs:
    kind = ActionLike

else if B_in.is_empty() AND wireable_out_types ⊆ {Number, Series, Bool, String}:
    kind = SourceLike

else if has_wireable_event_out:
    kind = TriggerLike

else:
    kind = ComputeLike
```

BoundaryKind is determined solely by boundary wireability, not by internal node kinds except as they affect wireability. The `has_side_effects` flag does not influence BoundaryKind.

### Step 5: Assemble Signature

```
Signature {
    kind: kind,
    inputs: B_in.map(to_port_spec),
    outputs: B_out.map(to_port_spec),
    has_side_effects: has_side_effects,
    is_origin: is_origin,
}
```

---

## 4. Declared Signature Verification

If a cluster declares an explicit signature, it must be **compatible** with the inferred signature.

Compatibility rules:

```
declared.kind == inferred.kind

declared.inputs ⊆ inferred.inputs  
    (declared may omit optional inputs)

declared.outputs ⊆ inferred.outputs  
    (declared may expose fewer outputs)

declared.has_side_effects == inferred.has_side_effects
    (cannot hide side effects)

declared.is_origin == inferred.is_origin
    (cannot claim origin if it isn't)
```

A declared signature may not mark a port as wireable if the inferred port is non-wireable. Declarations constrain; they cannot grant capabilities.

If declared signature is incompatible, the cluster definition is invalid.

---

## 5. Wiring Matrix

The wiring matrix for clusters mirrors the ontological primitive wiring matrix:

```
SourceLike  → ComputeLike  : allowed
SourceLike  → TriggerLike  : forbidden (v0)
ComputeLike → ComputeLike  : allowed
ComputeLike → TriggerLike  : allowed
ComputeLike → ActionLike   : forbidden (must be mediated by Trigger)
TriggerLike → TriggerLike  : allowed
TriggerLike → ActionLike   : allowed
ActionLike  → *            : forbidden (terminal)
*           → SourceLike   : forbidden (origin)
```

This matrix applies at every nesting level.

---

## 6. Validation Rules

### 6.1 Definition-Time Validation

When a cluster is saved, validate:

1. **Internal DAG structure**
   - Cluster must contain at least one node
   - No cycles
   - All edges reference existing nodes and ports
   - All edges satisfy wiring matrix (including nested cluster boundary kinds)

2. **Port validity**
   - Every output port references a valid internal node output
   - Every input port has a unique name
   - Every output port has a unique name

3. **Parameter validity**
   - All parameters have valid types
   - Defaults are type-compatible
   - No duplicate parameter names

4. **Signature inference succeeds**
   - Algorithm completes without error
   - If declared signature exists, compatibility check passes
   - Declared wireable must not exceed inferred wireability (declared.wireable ⇒ inferred.wireable)

5. **Context independence**
   - Definition-time validation must not depend on parent context. A cluster is valid or invalid independent of where it is instantiated.

### 6.2 Instantiation-Time Validation

When a cluster is placed in a parent context, validate:

1. **Wiring compatibility**
   - Parent edge source's kind allows wiring to this cluster's kind
   - Port types match at connection points

2. **Parameter completeness**
   - All required parameters are either bound or exposed
   - Bound values are type-compatible
   - Exposed parameters exist in parent context

3. **Version compatibility**
   - Requested version exists
   - Version constraints are satisfied

### 6.3 Expansion-Time Validation

Before execution, after full expansion, validate:

1. **Full DAG validation**
   - No cycles in expanded graph
   - All edges are valid
   - All required inputs are connected

2. **Type compatibility**
   - All edge connections have matching types

3. **Execution preconditions**
   - All nodes pass validation before any action executes
   - All parameters are bound to concrete values

---

## 7. Expansion Algorithm

### 7.1 Full Expansion

```
expand(cluster_def) -> ExpandedGraph:
    graph = initialize_graph()
    
    for node in cluster_def.nodes:
        if node.kind is Impl:
            graph.add_implementation(node)
        else if node.kind is Cluster:
            nested_def = load_cluster(node.cluster_id, node.version)
            nested_def = apply_bindings(nested_def, node.parameter_bindings)
            nested_graph = expand(nested_def)  # Recursive
            graph.inline(node.id, nested_graph)
    
    for edge in cluster_def.edges:
        graph.add_edge(resolve(edge))
    
    return graph
```

### 7.2 Node Identity Preservation

After expansion, preserve authoring-level identity for debugging:

```
ExpandedNode {
    runtime_id: UniqueId,
    authoring_path: List<(ClusterId, NodeId)>,
    implementation: ImplementationInstance,
}
```

The `authoring_path` traces back through the cluster hierarchy.

### 7.3 Expansion Output Invariant

The expansion process may introduce internal representation types for
implementation convenience.

However, the **expanded graph is a structural artifact only**.

The expansion output MUST contain only:
- Graph topology (nodes and edges)
- Implementation identity (`impl_id`, `version`)
- Authoring trace information (`authoring_path` or equivalent)

The expansion output MUST NOT contain:
- Resolved types or manifests
- Side-effect semantics
- Execution behavior
- Validation results
- Inferred properties (including BoundaryKind, wireability, or flags)
- Any other semantic or behavioral information

All semantics beyond identity are introduced strictly in later phases:
signature inference, validation, and execution.

Any expansion output that carries semantic information beyond identity
is non-compliant with this specification.

---

## 8. Signature Hash

The signature hash enables breaking change detection.

### 8.1 Hash Computation

```
signature_hash(sig: Signature) -> Hash:
    canonical = canonicalize(sig)
    return hash(serialize(canonical))

canonicalize(sig):
    return {
        kind: sig.kind,
        inputs: sort_by_name(sig.inputs).map(canonicalize_port),
        outputs: sort_by_name(sig.outputs).map(canonicalize_port),
        has_side_effects: sig.has_side_effects,
        is_origin: sig.is_origin,
    }

canonicalize_port(port):
    return {
        name: port.name,
        ty: port.ty,
        cardinality: port.cardinality,
        wireable: port.wireable,
    }
```

### 8.2 Breaking Change Detection

```
is_breaking_change(old_sig, new_sig) -> bool:
    return signature_hash(old_sig) != signature_hash(new_sig)
```

Changes that modify the hash:
- Adding/removing/renaming ports
- Changing port types or cardinality
- Changing wireability
- Changing boundary kind
- Changing side effect or origin flags

## 9. Edge Cases

### 9.1 Cluster with Only Actions

A cluster containing only actions (e.g., "Emergency Exit"):

```
Cluster:
    inputs: [trigger: Event]
    internal: [action: ExitAll(trigger)]
    outputs: []  # or only non-wireable ack
```

Inference:
- `has_wireable_outputs = false`
- `BoundaryKind = ActionLike`
- `has_side_effects = true`

Valid. Can only be wired from TriggerLike outputs.

### 9.2 Cluster with Trigger Output and Internal Action

A cluster that emits an event AND executes an action:

```
Cluster:
    inputs: []
    internal:
        [source] → [compute] → [trigger] → [action]
                                    ↓
                            (exposed as output)
    outputs: [signal: Event (wireable)]
```

Inference:
- `has_wireable_outputs = true`
- `has_wireable_event_out = true`
- `BoundaryKind = TriggerLike`
- `has_side_effects = true`

Valid. The cluster behaves as a Trigger (produces wireable events) but also has side effects.

### 9.3 Empty Cluster

A cluster with no nodes:

Invalid at definition time. Clusters must contain at least one node.

### 9.4 Cluster with No Outputs

A cluster with inputs but no outputs:

```
Cluster:
    inputs: [data: Number]
    internal: [compute: LogValue(data)]  # logs but produces no output
    outputs: []
```

Inference:
- `has_wireable_outputs = false`
- `BoundaryKind = ActionLike`
- `has_side_effects = false` (if LogValue is pure)

This is unusual but valid. The cluster is terminal from a wiring perspective.

## 10. Implementation Notes

### 10.1 Rust IR Representation

```rust
enum BoundaryKind {
    SourceLike,
    ComputeLike,
    TriggerLike,
    ActionLike,
}

struct Signature {
    kind: BoundaryKind,
    inputs: Vec<PortSpec>,
    outputs: Vec<PortSpec>,
    has_side_effects: bool,
    is_origin: bool,
}

struct PortSpec {
    name: String,
    ty: ValueType,
    cardinality: Cardinality,
    wireable: bool,
}
```

### 10.2 Validation Performance

Signature inference requires expansion, which can be expensive for deeply nested clusters.

Optimization: cache inferred signatures by (cluster_id, version). Signatures are immutable once computed.

Cache invalidation must consider transitive dependencies (nested cluster versions, implementation manifest versions) and ontology version. Incorrect caching is a compliance violation.

Ontology version is implementation-defined in v0; recommended sources include the crate/build version or a hash of the ontology + execution model bundle used at compile time.
